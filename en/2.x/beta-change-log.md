### v2.0.7-beta

Posted on 2020/11/15

To upgrade the method, execute the following command step by step
```bash

**Functional improvements**

1. Introduce the [jquery.initialize](https://github.com/pie6k/jquery.initialize) component to listen to dynamically generated page elements and set a callback, the following is a simple example to demonstrate usage.

In older versions, if an element is dynamically generated by `JS`, and we need to bind a click event to that element, then we usually do this

```html
<div class="selector">test</div>

<script>
Dcat.ready(function () {
    // You need to be off first and then on, otherwise page refresh will cause double bind problem.
    $(document).off('click', '.selector').on('click', '.selector', function () {
        ...
    })
});
</script>
```

The above approach is troublesome, you need to `off` and then `on`; secondly, you can not do some special treatment for dynamically generated elements, for example, if you want to change the background color after `.selector` is generated, there is no way to do this.

In this version we can use the `Dcat.init` method to listen to the dynamically generated elements.

```html
<div class="selector">test</div>

<script>
Dcat.ready(function () {
    // $this is the jquery dom object of the current element.
    // id is the id attribute of the current element, if the current element has no id, a random id will be generated automatically.
    Dcat.init('.selector', function ($this, id) {
        // Change the background color of the element.
        $this.css({background: "#fff"});
        
        // There's no need for off and then on again, because the anonymous function will only be executed once!
        $this.on('click', function () {
            ...
        });
    });
});
</script>
```

Thanks to the introduction of the [jquery.initialize](https://github.com/pie6k/jquery.initialize) component, in the current version we have optimized the front-end code of the form component to support the dynamically generated form type `HasMany` more easily. Significantly reduces the complexity of the code.


2.Form::hasMany and Form::array forms support column and row layout

If there are more fields, you can use `column` and `row` layout to save space.

```php
$form->array('field', function (NestedForm $form) {
    $form->column(6, function (NestedForm $form) {
        $form->text('...');
        
        ...
    });
    
    $form->column(6, function (NestedForm $form) {
        ...
    });
});
```

3.Routes configured with the admin.auth.except parameter do not require authentication privileges [#673](https://github.com/jqhph/dcat-admin/issues/673)


4. Add when method to Form, Grid and Show field classes

Usage examples, similar to `Laravel QueryBuilder`s `when` method

in the table
```php
// Closing code will be executed when the first parameter is true.
$grid->column('title')->when(true, function (Grid\Column $column, $value) {
    $column->label();
});
```

form (document)
```php
// Closing code will be executed when the first parameter is true.
$form->text('email')->when(true, function (Form\Field\Text $text, $value) {
    $text->type('email');
});
```

5. Administrator model add canSeeMenu method to control whether the menu is visible or not.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Dcat\Admin\Models\Administrator as Model;

class Administrator extends Model
{
    /**
     * :: Control whether the menu is visible or not, return true by default
     * 
     * @param array|\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model $menu menu node
     * @return bool
     */
    public function canSeeMenu($menu)
    {
        return true;
    }
}
```

6.Add admin_script、admin_style、admin_js、admin_css and admin_require_assets functions

```php
// Equivalent to Admin::script
admin_script('console.log(xxx)');

// Equivalent to Admin::style
admin_style('.my-class {color: red}');

// Equivalent to Admin::js() 
admin_js(['@admin/xxx.js']);

// Equivalent to Admin::css() 
admin_css(['@admin/xxx.css']);

// Equivalent to Admin::requireAssets() 
admin_require_assets(['@select2']);
```

7. simplify the action (Action) of the `JS` code logic, to remove the memory of the `selector` function

**BUG FIX**

1. Fix anomaly in the orderable form [#674](https://github.com/jqhph/dcat-admin/issues/674)
2. fix the JsonResponse methodIf error.
3. fix table, form, and data detail specifying `label` [#684](https://github.com/jqhph/dcat-admin/issues/684)
4. fix the problem that the table `Grid::rows` callback doesn't work properly.
5. fix the problem of some types of statistical cards failing to load asynchronously due to exceptions in adding `JS` code to widgets.
6. fix the getKey method exception for table row operations [#691](https://github.com/jqhph/dcat-admin/issues/691)
7. fix the problem of not being able to use the linkage function when there are multiple select forms in the page.
8. Fix the problem of the table not being able to refresh automatically after deleting data.
